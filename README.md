This is a project for my university course Cloud Computing at the Upper Austrian University of Applied Science in Hagenberg. The purpose of this project is to explore the strength of graph databases by the example of the "getting to Philosophy" game on wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy
A graphical real-time web application using a crawler can be found here: http://www.xefer.com/wikipedia
There is also a detailed analysis from August 2011 about the number of sites that transitively "first-"link to Philosophy as well as their number of hops: http://matpalm.com/blog/2011/08/13/wikipedia-philosophy/

Our approach will use a dump of the English wikipedia which can be obtained here: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html
We downloaded a copy of the English article database from 2014-12-08 using a torrent client. Torrent files can be found here: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dump_torrents#enwiki

We hope to find some interesting facts or at least give you some up-to-date figures about this little game ;)
